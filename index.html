              <h4>My Story</h4>
              <p>My journey through life has been accompanied by a constant inclination toward exploration and expansion. After receiving an Associates of Science degree from Utah State University, I set my sights toward broadening my horizons. My travels haven taken me many places. My feet have carried me from the Coastal Redwoods of California, to the gorgeous beaches of Thailand, the lively Jungles of Costa Rica, and many wondeful places in between. My path has led me here, to an exploration of programming and a dive into the depths of creation and technology.</p>
